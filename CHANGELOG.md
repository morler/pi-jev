# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Jev API platform selection via `JEV_PLATFORM`: `typesafe` (default), `openrouter`, `cloudflare`, and `vercel`. Tools, skills, gate CLI, typed agent, auto mode, and compaction all follow the selected platform.
- Per-platform credential resolution from environment variables or Pi secret files (`openrouter_api_key`, `cloudflare_api_token`, `ai_gateway_api_key`), plus `JEV_MODEL` as a model override for any platform.
- `/jev status` reports the active platform, and error messages name the missing credential for it.

### Changed
- `/jev status` reports the real credential origin (`$TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or the secret file) instead of always reporting "set in-session".

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Jev Gate CLI binary (`bin/jev-gate.js`, exposed as `pi-jev-gate` and `jev-gate`) for subagent post-run `gate` checks and CI/CD validation. Evaluates git diff, stdin, or files against acceptance criteria with fast System One noul probability.
- Typed Jev Subagent (`agent: "jev"` / `agentType: "jev"`) handler in `pi-subagents` RPC for sub-second, zero-LLM-overhead choice, score, and probability decisions inside workflows.

### Fixed
- `/jev agents <task>` now directly constructs multi-agent `workflowScript` topologies delegating to builtin agents (`scout`, `worker`, `reviewer`, `researcher`, `evidence-auditor`), replacing single `delegate` subagent calls.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Opt-in automatic model routing via `--jev-auto-model`, `PI_JEV_AUTO_MODEL=1`, and `/jev auto-model [on|off]`.
- Model profiles for fast, balanced, reasoning, long-context, and vision tasks. Selection respects scoped models and attached images.
- Provider-limit handling: quota, rate-limit, timeout, unavailable, auth, and context-limit errors are classified; retry-prone models are temporarily avoided on later prompts without loops or silent truncation.
- Opt-in Jev-guided `/compact` via `--jev-compact`, `PI_JEV_COMPACT=1`, or `/jev compact on`. Important tool history is retained in a custom compaction summary, with Pi's built-in summary as fail-open fallback.
- Explicit agent orchestration via `/jev agents <task>` and opt-in automatic orchestration via `--jev-agents`, `PI_JEV_AGENTS=1`, or `/jev auto-agents on`, using the installed `pi-subagents` RPC.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-17

### Documentation
- Add secret store key resolution option (`~/.pi/agent/secrets/typesafe_api_key`) to Setup section in README.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Dynamic evaluation command: `/jev test <prompt>` (aliases `/jev eval`, `/jev evaluate`) asks the session's active model to design the Jev question schema from the user's prompt, then runs it on TypeSafe Jev. `/jev test` alone still runs the fixed smoke test.
- Automatic mode: `--jev-auto` flag / `PI_JEV_AUTO=1` env var and `/jev auto [on|off]` command run one Jev routing pass before each prompt, activating tools and surfacing matching skills.

### Changed
- Single activation threshold `JEV_THRESHOLD` (0.65) in `src/skills.ts`, used by the router, both tools, `/jev skills`, and auto mode. `/jev skills` previously used 0.6, so manual skill search could show matches auto mode hid.

### Fixed
- Router no longer offers `pi-jev`'s own tools as routing candidates. After `/jev disable`, automatic routing used to re-activate `jev_find_skill` and `jev_evaluate`.
- `/jev` subcommands now match exactly, so `/jev autofoo on` and `/jev skillsfoo` report an error instead of silently toggling or searching.
- `/jev skills` discloses local heuristic fallback instead of presenting 1.00 probabilities as Jev judgments.
- `/jev status` reports where the API key came from (`$TYPESAFE_API_KEY` vs `~/.pi/agent/secrets/typesafe_api_key`) and counts only genuinely routable tools.
- `/jev help` lists usage at info level instead of warn-as-unknown-command.
- Router and skill fallback tests no longer depend on the machine being unconfigured.
- `npm run smoke` passes `-ne` so it no longer collides with an already-installed `pi-jev` copy.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- `jev_find_skill` tool and `/jev skills [query]` command for semantic skill discovery and recommendation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Initial public release of `pi-jev` package for the Pi coding agent.
- `jev_find_tools` tool for semantic candidate shortlisting and additive tool activation.
- `jev_evaluate` tool exposing typed TypeSafe Jev decisions (Choice, Noul, Score).
- `/jev` slash commands (`status`, `enable`, `disable`, `test`).
- Bounded TypeSafe client integration with safe error handling and usage accounting.
- Comprehensive unit test suite and CI workflows.
